Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - Cat Clicker App
============================

What did I learn in this project?
--------------------------------
This project focused on how to approach working with an unfamiliar organizational library, learning its key concepts and features, and how to implement them. I used Knockout.js in this case to create a cat clicker app. The app displays a list of cat names. When a name is clicked, a picture of that cat is shown along with the following: the name of the cat, the age level of the cat, and the number of times the cat's picture has been clicked. These parts of the UI are connected to the data model through the use of declarative bindings, and the view is updated automatically based on changes to the data model. The count of clicks for each cat and the age level (based on reaching a certain number of clicks) are updated as the user clicks.

I learned how to use numerous Knockout.js features to simplify my code, requiring less manual work done to update the current view as a result of Knockout.js declarative bindings and automatic UI refresh. Other concepts in Knockout.js I learned and applied to the app include: Control flow (with and for each bindings), observables and observable arrays, computed observables, and managing a hierarchy of binding contexts.
